= About

This folder contains course materials for "Project X": a semester-long team software engineering exercise, developed for teams of ~4 undergraduate students to work together towards a self-directed "real world" custom software deliverable in a fast-paced, exciting learning framework.

These materials are language and technology agnostic, and may easily be adapted to taste. (At minimum you will need to change delivery dates, institution and instructor names etc.) Plain-text documents are provided in the LaTeX typesetting language, and thus may be restyled and/or rendered for different delivery mediums with minimal effort. Both Project X and optional Project X' (pronounced "Ex Prime") extension have been successfully classroom tested and are available to you under a friendly Creative Commons license.
